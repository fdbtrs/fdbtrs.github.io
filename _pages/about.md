I am a scientific researcher at the [Fraunhofer Institute for Computer Graphics Research (IGD)](https://www.igd.fraunhofer.de/en/institute/employees/fadi-boutros.html) and a principal investigator at the [National Research Center for Applied Cybersecurity ATHENE](https://www.athene-center.de/en/about-us/contact), Germany. I am also participating in the [Software Campus project](https://softwarecampus.de/en/participant/2022/fadi-boutros/), a management project supported by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF). I received my [Ph.D.](https://tuprints.ulb.tu-darmstadt.de/21571/) in computer science from the technical university of Darmstadt in 2022 (grade: passed with distinction, summa cum laude). 
I am interested in Computer Vision and Machine Learning, specifically, deep feature extraction, segmentation, and image synthesis. My research experience includes computationally efficient and high-performing deep face recognition, synthetic data generation for face recognition development, and deep learning model compression techniques.
