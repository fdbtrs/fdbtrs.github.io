I am a scientific researcher at the Fraunhofer Institute for Computer Graphics Research (IGD) and a principal investigator at the National Research Center for Applied Cybersecurity ATHENE, Germany. I am also participating in the Software Campus project, a management project supported by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF). I received my Ph.D. in computer science from the technical university of Darmstadt in 2022 (grade: passed with distinction, summa cum laude). 
I am interested in Computer Vision and Machine Learning, specifically, deep feature extraction, segmentation, and image synthesis. My research experience includes computationally efficient and high-performing deep face recognition, synthetic data generation for face recognition development, and deep learning model compression techniques.
